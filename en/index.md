## Manual (english)

This is the manual for the Rancilio PID project. It covers all the steps necessary for your own build.

We recommended you read the introduction. It explains the requirements to a successful upgrade of your machine with a PID. It describes as well the abilities and limitations of the PID.

The first step towards your own PID is procuring the parts as per the provided list, depending on what functionality you want and what equipment is available. While you are waiting for the parts to come, there is time to install and set up the required software. Once the parts are assembled, the controller is flashed with the current software and everything is installed into your espresso machine. After successful initial testing you will find many customization options in the last chapter of the manual.
